        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>In 1938, the American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented, called Lexiko. The two games had the same set of letter tiles, whose distributions and point values Butts worked out by performing a frequency analysis of letters from various sources, including The New York Times. The new game, which he called Criss-Crosswords, added the 15×15 gameboard and the crossword-style gameplay. He manufactured a few sets himself but was not successful in selling the game to any major game manufacturers of the day.</p>
        <p>In 1948, James Brunot, a resident of Newtown, Connecticut, and one of the few owners of the original Criss-Crosswords game, bought the rights to manufacture the game in exchange for granting Butts a royalty on every unit sold. Although he left most of the game (including the distribution of letters) unchanged, Brunot slightly rearranged the "premium" squares of the board and simplified the rules; he also renamed the game Scrabble, a real word which means "to scratch frantically". In 1949, Brunot and his family made sets in a converted former schoolhouse in Dodgingtown, Connecticut, a section of Newtown. They made 2,400 sets that year but lost money.According to legend, Scrabble's big break came in 1952 when Jack Straus, president of Macy's, played the game on vacation. Upon returning from vacation, he was surprised to find that his store did not carry the game. He placed a large order, and within a year, "everyone had to have one".</p>
        <p>In 1952, unable to meet demand himself, Brunot licensed the manufacturing rights to Long Island-based Selchow and Righter, one of the manufacturers who, like Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley Company, had previously rejected the game. "It's a nice little game. It will sell well in bookstores," Selchow and Righter president Harriet T. Righter remembered saying about Scrabble when she first saw it. In its second year as a Selchow and Righter product, 1954, nearly four million sets were sold  Selchow and Righter then bought the trademark to the game in 1972</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, JW Spear acquired the rights to sell the game in Australia and the UK on January 19, 1955. In 1986, Selchow and Righter was sold to Coleco, which soon afterward went bankrupt. Hasbro then purchased Coleco's assets in 1989, including Scrabble and Parcheesi. Mattel then acquired JW Spear in 1994.Since then, Hasbro has owned the rights to manufacture Scrabble in the U.S. and Canada, and Mattel has held the rights to manufacture the game in other parts of the world</p>
        <p>In 1984, Scrabble was turned into a daytime game show on NBC. The Scrabble game show ran from July 1984 to March 1990, with a second run from January to June 1993. The show was hosted by Chuck Woolery. Its tagline in promotional broadcasts was, "Every man dies; not every man truly Scrabbles." In 2011, a new TV variation of Scrabble, called Scrabble Showdown, aired on The Hub cable channel, which is a joint venture of Discovery Communications, Inc. and Hasbro.

            Scrabble was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2004</p>

            <h1>Rules And Regulations</h1>
            <h4>Notation System</h4>
            <p>In the notation system common in tournament play, columns are labeled with the letters "A–O" and rows with the numbers "1–15". (On Scrabble boards manufactured by Mattel as well as on the Internet Scrabble Club, rows are lettered while columns are numbered instead.) A play is usually identified in the format xy WORD score or WORD xy score, where x denotes the column or row on which the play's main word extends, y denotes the second coordinate of the main word's first letter, and WORD is the main word. Although it is unnecessary, additional words formed by the play are sometimes listed after the main word and a slash. When the play of a single tile forms words in each direction, one of the words is arbitrarily chosen to serve as the main word for purposes of notation.</p>
            <p>When a blank tile is employed in the main word, the letter it has been chosen to represent is indicated with a lower case letter, or, in handwritten notation, with a square around the letter. When annotating a play, previously existing letters on the board are usually enclosed in parentheses; alternatively, the number of tiles placed on the board can be noted.</p>
            <p>Exchanges are often annotated by a minus sign followed by the tiles that were exchanged alphabetically; for example, if a player holds EIIISTU, exchanging two I's and a U would be denoted as "−IIU".</p>
            <p>Additionally, a number of symbols have been employed to indicate the validity of words in different lexica:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>An asterisk (*) means an illegal, or phony, word.</li>
                <li>A hash symbol (#) means a word valid in games using the British-originated word list (CSW) only.</li>
                <li>A dollar symbol ($) means a word valid in games using the American-originated word list (TWL) only.</li>
                <li>An exclamation mark (!) means a word judged to be offensive, and thus valid in tournament games only.</li>            
            </ul></p>
            <h4>Sequence of play</h4>
            <p>Before the game, a resource, either a word list or a dictionary, is selected to adjudicate any challenges during the game. The tiles are either put in an opaque bag or placed face down on a flat surface. Opaque cloth bags and customized tiles are staples of clubs and tournaments, where games are rarely played without both.A game of Scrabble in French Next, players decide the order in which they play. The normal approach is for players to each draw one tile. The player who picks the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet goes first, with blank tiles taking precedence over the letter A. In most North American tournaments, the rules of the NASPA Games organization stipulate instead that players who have gone first in the fewest previous games in the tournament go first, and when that rule yields a tie, those who have gone second the most go first. If there is still a tie, tiles are drawn as in the standard rules. At the beginning of the game, each player draws seven tiles from the bag and places them on their rack, concealed from the other player(s).</p>
            <h6>Making a play</h6>
            <p>The first played word must be at least two letters long, and cover H8 (the center square). Thereafter, any move is made by using one or more tiles to place a word on the board. This word may use one or more tiles already on the board and must join with the cluster of tiles already on the board.</p>
            <p>The first played word must be at least two letters long, and cover H8 (the center square). Thereafter, any move is made by using one or more tiles to place a word on the board. This word may use one or more tiles already on the board and must join with the cluster of tiles already on the board.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pass, forfeiting the turn and scoring nothing.</li>
                <li>Exchange one or more tiles for an equal number from the bag, scoring nothing, an option available only if at least seven tiles remain in the bag.</li>
                <li>Play at least one tile on the board, adding the value of all words formed to the player's cumulative score.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A proper play uses one or more of the player's tiles to form a continuous string of letters that make a word (the play's "main word") on the board, reading either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. The main word must either use the letters of one or more previously played words or else have at least one of its tiles horizontally or vertically adjacent to an already played word. If any words other than the main word are formed by the play, they are scored as well and are subject to the same criteria of acceptability. See Scoring for more details.

                <div>A blank tile may represent any letter and scores zero points, regardless of its placement or what letter it represents. Its placement on a double-word or triple-word square causes the corresponding premium to be applied to the word(s) in which it is used. Once a blank tile is placed, it remains that particular letter for the remainder of the game.
                </div>
                <div>After making a play, the player announces the score for that play, and then, if the game is being played with a clock, starts the opponent's clock. The player can change their play as long as the player's clock is running, but commits to the play when they start the opponent's clock. The player then draws tiles from the bag to replenish their rack to seven tiles. If there are not enough tiles in the bag to do so, the player takes all the remaining tiles.
                </div>
                <div>If a player has made a play and has not yet drawn a tile, the opponent may choose to challenge any or all words formed by the play. The player challenged must then look up the words in question using a specified word source (such as the NASPA Word List, the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, or Collins Scrabble Words), and if one or more of them is found to be unacceptable, the play is removed from the board, the player returns the newly played tiles to their rack, and the turn is forfeited. In tournament play, a challenge may be to the entire play or any one or more words formed in the play, and judges (human or computer) are used, so players are not entitled to know which word(s) are invalid</p>
                </div>
                <h6>End Of Game</h6>
                <p>Under North American tournament rules, the game ends when either:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One player has played every tile on their rack, and no tiles remain in the bag.</li>
                        <li>At least six successive scoreless turns have occurred and either player decides to end the game.</li>
                        <li>Either player uses more than 10 minutes of overtime. (For several years, a game could not end with a cumulative score of 0–0, but that is no longer the case, and such games have since occurred a number of times in tournament play, the winner being the player with the lower total point value on their rack and thus a score less negative than the opponent's.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div>When the game ends, each player's score is reduced by the sum of their unused letters; in addition, if a player has used all of their letters (known as "going out" or "playing out"), the sum of all other players' unused letters is added to that player's score. In tournament play, a player who goes out adds twice that sum, and their opponent is not penalized.</div>

                <h1>Tips And Strategies To Win</h1>
                <h6>Learn the Two-Letter Words</h6>
                <p>One of the most significant words in Scrabble is "QI," which, according to some Chinese schools of thought, is a vital energy force and offers one of the few opportunities to discharge a "Q" without having access to a "U." Every board has opportunities that are only available to players that are familiar with two-letter words.<div>Additionally, playing overlapping words, which is a simple technique to get some of your letters to score twice, is one of the finest strategies to increase your average Scrabble score. If you haven't seen any of the less than 100 two-letter terms before, even reading them a few times will greatly enhance your performance.</div></p>
                <h6>Focus on the Hot Spots</h6>
                <p>Hot spots are the obvious places on the board, like where a triple-letter square is next to a vowel or a double- or even triple-word score square is available. As you play more Scrabble and begin to see more options, it can be easy to talk yourself out of utilizing hot spots. However, as a general rule of thumb, it is very often correct to use available hot spots. Much of the value in using a hot spot comes from denying your opponent that opportunity.</p>
                <h6>Look at Popular Bingos</h6>
                <p>In comparison to bingos made from a rack of one-letter tiles, bingos that include letters like "Z" or "Q" are much less frequent. These bingos are frequently regarded as "low probability." However, some of the most popular bingo games actually use them since you are more likely to be stuck with a "Z" or a "Q" for numerous turns.<div>You may find lists of both frequently played bingos and high-probability bingos online with a short search. Even just skimming through these lists will certainly introduce you to new terms that will come in handy during your Scrabble matches.
                </div>  </p>
                <h6> Hold Some Vowels and Some Consonants</h6>
                <p>Everyone has been in this situation: You play your word, pick up the bag, and hope to get some vowels, but when you look at your hand, all you see are four consonants. By paying more attention to your rack leaves before you make your play, you can assist prevent this.<div>When playing off vowels or consonants, try not to do so all at once. If you are considering playing all of one or the other, think about weighing the potential benefits of playing more letters against the potential disadvantages of holding onto unbalanced tiles by utilising the rough values you learned from the preceding suggestion.
                </div></p>
                <h6>Read the “Q Without a U” Words</h6>
                <p>Being stuck with a "Q" is a challenging situation. Fortunately, there are roughly 50 Scrabble terms that contain a "Q" without being followed by a "U," mostly because of our friends who come from nations where different languages are spoken. There are only 50, so this list warrants a bit further research. The reward is substantial.</p>
