            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This website is bascially about the board game - Scrable which is actually a word game and can be played by any age group people.This is not just a game but it also helps to improve the memory,sharps our brain, can learn many new words which in turn increase our vocabulary.This site has a home page, about page, review page and information page. Home page has a basci description information and video about the agme, information page has detailed information about the game from history to how to paly the game, review page has the review of players.I actually chose this game because now-a-days people are more engaged in their phones and usually spends less time playing board games. If any one come across my site, he/she may develop interest in playing this game, if not physically then they can also play it virtually and he/she may benefit from playing this game as it has many benefits discussed above.Also, when i was in my school, i was given the same kind of topic and had to made a presentation to explain this game and honestly speaking, i was not into such games at all, but when i got to know about it in more detail, i was obsessed playing this game and it helped me to increase the vocabulary . <div><h3>About me: </h3><ul><li>Name: <strong>Smit Pankaj Italia</strong> <li>ID:<strong>169670213</strong></li><li>Section:<strong>NCC</strong></li></ul></div></p>
